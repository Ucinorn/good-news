  Marie Ryan and Phyllis Jallais were two amazing women.

  Sadly, they died six months apart.

They never met each other but they’ve come together in spirit. Literally.

Their respective children – Serena Ryan and Glenn Taylor - are best friends. And when they wanted to create a gin brand as a side hustle, it only seemed fit to honour their mums at the same time.

“My mum, Marie, loved gin and always said it ‘went down like Mother’s Milk’ – when I told Glenn this, he laughed and said we’d found our name – Mother’s Milk,” Serena says.

Serena says Marie was a lovely Irish lady who loved her family, a laugh and a good dose of mischief.

“Our first gin is a classic dry named Marie after my mum and she’s on the bottle.”

Meanwhile, Phyllis was a trailblazer. A woman before her time who loved adventure and raised Glenn as a single mother.

The first foray into gin distilling didn’t go so well. Serena admits they had no idea and a failed batch left her house smelling of oranges for weeks.

They have since learnt the craft at Gypsy Hub in Collingwood, Melbourne, where the gin is still produced. They haven’t looked back since.

“The more gin I make, the broader my palette becomes. I could talk about gin all day. I love it!”

Like many alcohol companies, Mother’s Milk has branched out into hand sanitizer during the coronavirus.

But their best seller is still their gin. They also have plans for a contemporary gin named Phyllis as well as a Pride gin as a nod to the LGBTIQ community and a Christmas gin called Festivus.

Serena says their ultimate goal is to turn their part-time business into a full-time gig.

“In 10 years I’d love to see myself working full time making gin in Melbourne at our own distillery, telling our mum’s stories and serving great gin. Personally, I would also dearly love to create a distillery in Ireland and bring mum home – that’s the real goal for me,” she says.

And with such a rich brand story, it’s obviously the perfect gift for Mother’s Day.
