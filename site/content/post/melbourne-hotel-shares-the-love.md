Yep, that’s right. The couple wed in Melbourne last weekend, sneaking the nuptials through before Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared a ban on weddings as we know them.

Michelle told The Good News they had to plan the wedding four times in the past 12 months due to a number of reasons, including the coronavirus.

\
“Neil and I agreed that if our wedding didn’t go ahead on the weekend then it probably would never go ahead - the most important people were with us and the show had to go on!” Michelle said.

\
With family visiting from Scotland, NSW and Queensland; the determined couple locked in a new venue for the reception at the Hotel Lindrum just days before the ceremony, allowing them to tie the knot in front of loved ones.

\
“It really was the most incredible day of our lives.”

\
Michelle joked that they had previously discussed what would happen at the alter; but said the now famous “elbow bump” was a spur of the moment reaction captured by their wedding photographer, John Warren.

\
And after planning the wedding four times; the bride has vowed she won’t be swapping careers as a wedding planner.
