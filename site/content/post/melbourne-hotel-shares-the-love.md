Located at South Wharf, the hotel has created a gigantic love heart created by lights on the west facing facade of the skyscraper.

\
The love heart greets motorists entering the city from the Westgate Freeway and the Bolte Bridge.

\
The size of the symbol is 13-stories high; but the impact to the community right now is far bigger.
