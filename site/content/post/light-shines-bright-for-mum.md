Georgia lost her mum, Belinda, to pancreatic cancer in 2016.\
While sitting by her bed in palliative care, Georgia googled if there was a pancreatic cancer foundation. It was the first time she had heard of Pancare – a support foundation for people suffering pancreatic and upper GI cancer. She immediately became determined to raise more awareness about the terminal illness, which has a five-year survival rate of only 9 per cent.\
“Unfortunately pancreatic is one of those cancers people don't like to talk about because the statistics are so bad so I have taken it upon myself to change that,” Georgia told The Good News.\
Her joint fundraising effort with Pancare this Mother’s Day is a collaborative candle with Damselfly, where 100% of the profits will go towards research as well as support for sufferers and their families.\
“We played around with different quotes, I wanted to include the word 'Love' as of course, it was my Mum's name, and because it's a lovely Mother's Day message.\
“We also wanted a message that induced hope and good vibes, because so often cancer is surrounded with very sad and negative emotions. The simple message 'You are loved' met all this criteria,” she says.\
The candles are a perfect gift for Mother’s Day, which Georgia says is still a difficult time for her and others who have lost mothers.

“It is really, really difficult knowing everyone else is celebrating and spending time with their mothers when yours is no longer here. I think that's why I wanted to do this collaboration for Mother's Day specifically, because it gives me a positive aspect to the day as well as a chance to celebrate and acknowledge my own Mum while others are celebrating theirs.”\
Another day that will be filled with mixed emotions in Georgia’s upcoming wedding to fiancé, Lee, who she met on The Bachelorette.\
“I know she'd be incredibly proud of where I am in my career and how happy I am. But I also know she'd be really, really peed off that she's not here to celebrate with me. She loved a wedding.”\
Georgia’s advice is simple:\
“Just appreciate your mums. This doesn't mean posting on Instagram about her - actually spend time and make memories with her. Take photos with her and share laughs. They're the most cherished times,” Georgia says.\
