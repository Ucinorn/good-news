The initiative is a partnership by luxury car brand Lexus and their latest brand ambassador, leading businessman Mark Bouris.

\
The aim of the grant is to help small business owners take control of their journey, providing funds to execute an innovative idea that has been stalled due to Covid-19.

\
The fund is the brainchild of Bouris, who has a successful program called Mentored. The $100,000 pot of funds will be split four ways.

\
"To help develop the Lexus and Mentored Grant fills me with great pride and hope for the future," says Bouris.

\
"To know we're helping everyday Australians to get back on track to achieve their goals and excel on their journey - at such a critical time - is very important to me."

\
Lexus Australia chief executive Scott Thompson said the partnership aims to support future innovative small business people with big dreams to find their road to success.

\
"We're able to start discovering the wealth of knowledge and ambition in Australia's next generation of innovators and entrepreneurial talent," says Thompson.

\
Each successful grant recipient will receive a private 1-hour virtual meeting with Bouris to discuss their business idea.
