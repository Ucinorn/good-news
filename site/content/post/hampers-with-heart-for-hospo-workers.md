The hamper giveaway is the idea of Con Andronis, Managing Director of Clamms Seafood Wholesalers, in Yarraville.

Con, an industry stalwart of more than three decades, has leaned on the generosity of many seafood suppliers from across Australia to provide quality food products. It's the third week the hampers have been given away at Clamms. 

His motive is simple - to supply good food to good people.

"We know the hospo community is doing it tough right now. We're one big family and we look after each other," says Con.

"This initiative allows us to put great produce in the pantries and fridges of hundreds in need and ensures they can cook nutritious meals for themselves and their families," he says. 

Clamms is the biggest seafood supplier to the majority of Melbourne's leading restaurants. They have also felt the massive effect of the coronavirus; but are digging deep for the industry they love regardless.

Renowned Melbourne chef Ian Curley - owner of French Saloon and Kirk's Wine Bar - has also been supporting the charitable drive; along with Melbourne Racing Club executive chef Julian Robertshaw. The pair cooked up a storm including seafood soup and more than 550 servings of seafood paella. 

"We are the ones who get the limelight... but the people in the line out there are the one's who do all the hard work," says Curley.

The suppliers donating food supplies include: Huon Salmon, Tassal Salmon, Petuna Australia, Humptydoo Barramundi, Hiramasa Kingfish, Ora King Salmon, Goulburn River Trout, Goolwa Pipi Co, Cloudy Bay Clams and Fishtales, Blue Harvest, Austral Fisheries, Casa Iberica, Cobram Estate, Neds Bake, La Tortilleria, McCain Foods, Hotel Agencies and Levantine Hill supplied bottles of wine.

The Clamms giveaway will continue for as long as they can continue to get food donations.

Other hospitality venues are also digging deep for their hospo families, including the Australian Venue Co at The Hawthorn Hotel.

They've been donating meal packs for unemployed workers too.

"My main concern was for the visa workers in particular, knowing that they would not get the support that residents and nationals," says venue manager Grant Vink.

"We are now giving away about 1200 meals per week. People can pick up a pack of seven meals on Wednesdays or Fridays so they have at least a meal per day," he says.
