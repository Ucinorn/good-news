Justin Firgaira, pictured left, had been surfing with a mate at Knights Beach when he was knocked unconscious and left floating in the water.\
What unfolded next was captured on the video feed that is streamed to [swellnet.com](http://swellnet.com/?fbclid=IwAR3OqtuTF75tSg7NvFO8_6c-DmPrFM3d2bDr1vJ4V6lP5gVVGPQYipTCSTU) – an online bible for Aussie surfers searching for the best waves.\
Justin’s mate, filmmaker Brad Halstead, took a little while to realise his mate was in trouble.\
“We both agreed it was our last wave. He caught the first one, so when I couldn’t see him I just assumed he’d gone in as planned. I kept looking, but still couldn’t see him and something just didn’t feel right,” Brad says. "When I saw his board pop up and start tomb-stoning I knew he was in trouble and I had to move fast."\
Brad then tried to catch a wave to his mate but when he got there Justin's leash had come off, his board had washed away. "He was somewhere underwater and I couldn’t find him," Brad says.\
By this stage, onlookers from the shore who had seen the drama unfold had made their way to the beach to assist.

Brad found his mate who was unconscious, face down, and was starting to be sucked back out into the rip. It’s believed he had been under water for almost a minute.\
He then started to drag Justin to shore. “It was like everything I learnt during Bronze Medallion rescue training as a kid just came back to me. You don’t think about it; it just kicks in.”

Justin didn’t fully regain consciousness until he was back on the beach.\
“I don’t remember hitting my head, I vaguely remember taking off on the wave and then it’s a complete blank,” Justin, 38, says.\
The father of three believes his head hit the sand bottom that knocked him out.\
After regaining consciousness, Justin went to hospital where, apart from a perforated ear drum, concussion and a few grazes; he was given the all clear.\
He’s thankful of his mate’s life-saving efforts; acknowledging the outcome could have been very different had been surfing alone.\
“It’s a bit of a reality check,” Justin says.\
“To be honest, I’m egging to get back into the surf. But I’ve got to get over the trauma to my head and get my ear drum right. I’ll be more cautious in my wave selection in the future and I’m going to invest in a helmet for the days there are bigger waves.”\
Both Justin and Brad have been surfing together since they were teenagers.\
“You can’t repay that,” Justin says, forever indebted to his mate for his quick actions. “I’m just looking forward to having a few beers together when we can.”
