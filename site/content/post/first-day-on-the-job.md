The 26-year-old has been waiting for almost two years to get her work placement through Jobsupport, a federally funded program that matches, trains and supports people with an intellectual disability in permanent part time work.

\
“I’m really enjoying the job. I like my team members and I’m enjoying the chance to learn more about my role here at Woolworths,” Deanna told The Good News.

\
Gabrielle Bartlett, from Jobsupport, said she was super proud of Deanna and equally impressed with Woolies, who remained committed to placing Deanna during this challenging time.

\
“Woolworths have now employed 67 Jobsupport clients who have an average tenure of 10 years and 6 months - quite the testament to what the business stands for as a whole and their authentic value on diversity and inclusion,” Ms Bartlett said.

\
“This is a fantastic life changing story that I’m so proud to be a part of,” she said.
