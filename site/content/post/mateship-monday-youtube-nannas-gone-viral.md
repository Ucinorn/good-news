But never did the early learning teacher think she'd ever become a Youtube content creator.

"Technology has never been my forte, but I've learned to use it in creative ways to stay connected with my beautiful grandchildren," Lyn, 61, says.

"It's easy in times like this to feel isolated and disconnected from our family members," she says.

"As a result, my 'sheNANNAgans' Youtube channel was born."

The idea was an extension of her own covid conundrum where she was sending videos of her reading books to her two grandchildren.

She's now posting all her favourite stories online including Aussie favourite Possum Magic, Wombat Stew and The Very Hungry Caterpillar. Just to name a few.

Her Instagram page also has hundreds of followers and is a great resource for any parent or carer of young children.

"It's so fun for me to be able to share my stories and play ideas with people all over the world."
