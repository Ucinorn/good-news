Next door member Rob Montgomery was picking up his car from a mechanic in Chirnside Park when he witnessed the good deed.

\
In front of him was an elderly pensioner who needed her car fixed as her husband had just been admitted into a nursing home and she had to start driving again.

\
Her repairs cost $1000 - enough to strain anyone's bank accounts, let alone now.

\
Rob says the woman reached into her bag and started counting out cash.

\
"I watched as she started counting the hundred dollar notes," Rob says.

\
"As she reached $500, the owner held out his hand and said 'that's enough'."

\
The balance was paid by a mystery customer who was behind her at the Bridgestone service station in Chirnside Park when she dropped the car off in the morning.

\
Rob says she was confused at first, but when the penny dropped and she realised it was a good deed; she shed a tear and was very appreciative of the gesture.

\
"You hear stories like this when someone is $10 short at the petrol station but this is so much more than that," Rob says.

\
Rob has been a member of the Nextdoor community for about six months and says he likes knowing what's going on in his community.
