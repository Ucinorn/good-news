The partnership between Lion and Arnotts is just one of the brand partnerships that has shoppers in a frenzy.\
The Dare Iced Coffee slice is a mix of one of the country's most popular drinks while drawing inspiration from Arnott's classic Mint Slice. And the milky, coffee infused biscuit is a real treat.\
The Dairy Farmers Classic Chocolate Milk Tee Vee Snacks are also the result of combining the best of both worlds to create a double choc sensation.\
Both biscuits are the perfect morning tea or smoko snack... but get in fast, because they're only on sale for a limited time only.\
