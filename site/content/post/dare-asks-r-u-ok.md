Dare Iced Coffee, produced by Lion, has partnered with Australian suicide prevention charity R U OK? in an initiative to help Aussies look out for their mates.

Lion Dairy & Drinks MD Kathy Karabatsas said the partnership was all about creating conversations that could potentially be life-saving.

More than five million 500ml Dare bottles will carry the R U OK? messaging on the label leading up to R U OK? Day on September 11.

“The R U OK? message will be featured on front of pack, and on the back of pack there will be the four steps to help guide consumers on how best to start a conversation with a mate,” says Kathy.

“This long-term commitment by Dare will also support the cause by helping consumers to identify the signs that someone in their life may be struggling and to encourage a more meaningful conversation.”

Katherine Newton, CEO, R U OK? says the partnership is a vital one; now more than ever.

“2020 has been a challenging year for many, making it even more relevant for us to stay connected and, for those who are willing and able, offer support to those around us,” Katherine says.

“Encouraging Australians to make a mental note to check in with a mate and take a look at the tips on how to open a conversation, may just be the start of a meaningful conversation, and we know that an authentic conversation has the potential to positively change a life.”

The Dare iced coffee featuring the RU OK? messaging will be sold until mid-September.
