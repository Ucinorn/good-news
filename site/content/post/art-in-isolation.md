The series of photographs tapped into Sarah’s community of colleagues in the creative arts through her work as a TV unit stills photographer on the film sets of your favourite TV shows.

“I was working on three productions that shut down. We all lost our jobs in a matter of days literally mid scene,” Sarah says.

Now in self-isolation, Sarah has continued the series with the broader arts freelance community.

“The idea has now taken on a whole new meaning,” she says.

Sarah’s photographs show people inside their homes, behind windows and in doorways. Once the people agree to a shoot, Sarah is literally in their gardens or down the side of apartments taking the photos and communicating through glass windows. The end result is an artistic take on self-isolation.

“I love the layers between me and the subject. I shot a few frames of Mae, my daughter, and then friends in isolation. I really wanted to shoot my community that I work with and put faces to the hashtags that are floating around at the moment.”

Sarah also said the series has given herself purpose at this unique moment in history.

“I think its capturing the now and picking up my camera because I was missing it.”
