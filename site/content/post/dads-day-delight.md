  Father's Day is just around the corner.

But luckily the legends at Hugs and Heroes have got you covered. And you're helping a great cause at the same time!

While most of us won't get to see our Dad's to celebrate the occasion, two gift options have been created including the Can't Be With You Box and the Dad's Day Delivered Box. Both include the essential Father's Day gifts including a belt, socks, jocks and chocs.

The socks have been supplied by Posisocks, the recently launched sock range by Richmond captain Trent Cotchin. And the jocks are from Port Adelaide player Travis Boak's brand, Rogers, which were named as a tribute to his own father. The chocolate is from Hey Tiger.

Valued at over $80, the small companies have all come together to make the packs as affordable as possible and will be selling them for under $50.

Every box purchased will include a donation of 10 meals to OzHarvest who will distribute these to people doing it tough as a result of the pandemic. Each box will also buy a coffee for our hardworking frontline healthcare staff in Victoria through social media led initiative Buy Them a Coffee.

"It’s great to team up with some other small businesses that have a similar community focus to Posisocks and be able to do something that hopefully can help out, whilst also saying thanks to the real heroes, our amazing healthcare workers,” Cotchin says.

The initiative is part of the Hugs and Heroes campaign, created by two guys without work due to Covid, that has now seen over 13,000 coffees and meals distributed, as well as supporting a lot of small businesses doing it tough because of the pandemic.

“So many people are really struggling at the moment... hopefully (these boxes) give Dad something to smile about; and importantly keeps on giving to our healthcare workers and people in need,” says Boak.
