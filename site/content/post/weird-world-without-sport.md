It’s bizarre. Who has ever known a winter without a football season? Who ever imagined the Tokyo Olympics could be shunted a year down the track? Even the Tour de France has been grudgingly pushed back. The world of sport has been halted, and it’s not good for us.\
It feels incredibly weird heading north of Easter and there’s no footy, or anything else.\
And it happened at the start of the season, when we’ve been anxiously waiting on the edge of our couches waiting to get the competition underway. Crushing. Seriously.\
Sure, I’m highly sport-biased, I love it - playing it, watching it, watching my family and friends play, and watch it with them. It’s a powerful uniting bond for us. And so it’s left a gigantic hole in our lives.\
The importance of sport to our health, mental wellbeing, and social interaction is\
enormous. That ability to sit down on a Friday and Saturday night and enjoy a great game was just something we took for granted.\
Sport is an escape from the everyday. In the course of a match, we experience all the highs and lows of life. We can watch failure, heartbreak, suffering, pain, the battle back, hard work, sweat, success, exhilaration, victory, achievement, and the whole cycle unpredictably repeating multiple times. It’s addictive in a very good way, and it’s magic.

As soon as the time is right, and not a moment later, we need sport back. Did any of us imagine how much we missed it? The fun banter leading up to the weekend matches.\
Trying to lock in footy tips and claw your way up the tipping table. And the regular check on the ladder to work out what your team needs to do to move up. Miss it all so much!\
Sport is the glue of our society. Whether it’s playing it, or watching it, sport keeps us healthy and connected.\
Olympic athletes I really feel for. Their grand final has been pushed back a full year.\
While some like pentathlon gold medallist, Chloe Esposito, who is about to have a baby, now have a shot at another Games they would have otherwise missed, most others have to find a way to train and prepare for another 12 months. Of the 450 or so athletes Australia will send to Tokyo 2020 (in 2021!) only a handful can afford to train full-time.\
Most have to work and continually go back to their bosses to try and stretch their leave and training arrangements to make it all work. Good luck to them!\
I am so looking forward to the return of live sport. And I will never, ever again moan about going to the gym or racing around town to get the kids to their sport. Sport, I miss you, come back soon!
