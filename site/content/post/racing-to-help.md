Since the race season was suspended prior to the Australian Grand Prix, the Queensland-based team tuned their skills to making equipment that would help in the current medical crisis.

\
Triple Eight team manager Mark Dutton said the idea originally came from team boss Roland Dane. “One week we’re at the race track trying to go fast and then the next thing the whole world is screaming out for ventilators, so you know, stop in your tracks, do a full 180 and do something completely different,” Dutton told Supercars.com

\
The invention has been backed by the Queensland Government, who praised the team using local materials.\
Other racing teams from around the world have also similarly used their resources, including the Mercedes-Benz F1 team who have helped develop a device that provides oxygen to lungs without the need of a ventilator.
