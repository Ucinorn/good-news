Using more than 150,000 LEGO bricks, the 3.3-metre long dreamscape weighs approximately 210kgs and took a team of eight builders over 650 hours to construct.\
The epic build was led by LEGO Masters TV co-host Ryan “The Brickman” McNaught and was commissioned by car brand, Honda.

Dubbed “Mount Hondarama”, the build was The Brickman’s most challenging build this year.\
“Moving parts are very challenging to do with LEGO, let alone having cars actually racing around a LEGO model,” says Ryan, who is globally a LEGO Certified Professional.\
“Our mantra is to grab people’s attention with something obvious and then hold their attention with lots of special details and fun things,” he says.\
Last year, Honda commissioned a life-size recreation of the best-selling Civic Type R. That project was much bigger, with more than double the amount of bricks and time used to create the car. In fact, carsales.com.au rated the vehicle as the best full-size LEGO car ever built.\
Honda has a strong affiliation with Mt Panorama.\
In 2019, the Japanese car-maker set a benchmark lap time for a front-wheeled drive production car driven by F1 World Champion Jenson Button.\
Honda is a sponsor of the top-rating Channel 9 TV show, Lego Masters.
