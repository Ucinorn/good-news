Located just 4km from the CBD in Hamilton, the six-bedroom home looks like your average ‘Queenslander’ house.

But two levels down, there’s a skate bowl, literally, in the living room.

Since hitting the market, the 9x12 metre in-ground concrete bowl has led to the house getting international attention by skating fanatics keen to call the unique property home.

The agent selling the property is Drew Davies, from Place Estate Agents in Ascot, who first met the vendors many years ago.

The story goes that the vendor’s son was on crutches and when Drew asked what happened, he was surprised when he told he was skating in their private skate bowl.

Years later, Drew is now selling the property with a disclaimer that the property is being sold without a price, presumably because it’s so unique it’s hard to provide a price guide.

To complete its dream home status, the three level property has a large background with landscaped surrounds and a solar heated in-ground pool, multiple indoor and outdoor entertaining spaces and a guest quarters with its own kitchenette and ensuite.

The house will go to auction on June 6.
