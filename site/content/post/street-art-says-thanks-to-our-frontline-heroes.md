The artwork, on a newsagency in the bayside suburb of Black Rock, has gone viral since it was completed over the weekend.\
The iconic image shows a medical worker with angel wings holding the world in their hands.\
It was created by @melbournesmurals, who said on an instagram post: "THANK YOU to all medics who are out there fighting the fight."\
The creator urged people to share the image with any friends working on the frontline helping fight COVID-19, so we thought we'd share on The Good News. The artwork can be seen at 606 Balcombe Rd, Black Rock.\
