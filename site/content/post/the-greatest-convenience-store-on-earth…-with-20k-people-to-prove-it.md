The Redfern Convenience Store isn’t the biggest shop in Sydney, but what it lacks in size it certainly makes up in community and entrepreneurial spirit.\
And it’s probably why the corner shop – that dubs itself the “greatest convenience store on earth” – also boasts almost 20,000 Instagram followers.\
In fact, it’s fair to say it’s owner, Hazem Sedda, has well and truly hit convenience store fame at a level not seen since Apu from the Kwik-E-Mart starred on The Simpsons.\
“My customers don’t see us as a corner shop. They come to see me and come to have a chat with me,” he said. “I also never look at them as a customer, I see them as friends.”\
“What I do makes them happy. The happier they are, the happier I am.”\
Just weeks ago, Hazem made national headlines when he was selling toilet paper when it was in extreme demand. A simple sign called out the craziness when he had priced one toilet roll at $3.50 and two for $99.\
But humour aside, it’s Hazem’s love of his community and his ambition to please his customers that has given the store cult status.\
“Our Instagram account isn’t about pushing sales for us, it’s about creating a community and showing our customers and how beautiful people are,” Hazem said.\
In fact, Hazem celebrates his customers every day by featuring them as the Customer of the Day in a social media post that tells the unique stories of his followers, some who travel interstate to visit the store.\
The shelves are stocked with products from across the world that can only be purchased at the store in Australia including limited edition lines like cinnamon flavoured Coca-Cola, white chocolate Coco Pops, golden Kit Kats, the world’s hottest corn chips and the hard to get but extremely popular La Croix soft drinks.\
Big brands are even exclusively launching products at the store before they hit the mainstream supermarkets across the country.\
The store also has its own merchandise range and online shop with customers interstate and even overseas.\
“Most convenience store’s customers are within a 2km radius of the store. This week, we’ve sent products to Singapore, Canada, USA and the UK. They find us on Instagram.”\
Born in Palestine, Hazem is a fully trained commercial pilot but says it’s his passion for working behind the counter and the community that keeps him grounded.\
“Being a pilot, you don’t communicate with humans. It’s all numbers and computers. Very rarely do you see a pilot speaking to a passenger on a plane. But I love to meet people and I’m much happier doing this. And I also get to be my own boss.”\
Hazem’s success has been assisted by TV personality Ben Fordham, who used to live in the neighbourhood and frequented the store as a customer.\
If you are in Sydney, visit Hazem at the Redfern Convenience Store at 152A Redfern Street, Redfern. You’ll see for yourself it’s not just any milk bar.
