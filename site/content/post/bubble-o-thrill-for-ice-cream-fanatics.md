One of Australia's favourite ice creams, the Bubble'O'Bill, is now being sold in take-home packs.

\
IGA supermarket Ritchies in Merbein, near Mildura, broke the news yesterday on their Facebook page and almost broke the internet with their post.

\
"You saw it here first," the post read.

\
It was sweet news for ice cream aficionados; with the rainbow Paddle Pop also available as a scoopable sensation.

\
In less than 8-hours, the social media post had more than twelve thousand comments - many desperate to find out where they could get their hands on the tubs.

\
Susan Gladstone asked if the bubblegum is still included in the new version, while others called for the product to be sold in Melbourne and as far as New Zealand.

\
Social media users also tagged friends and suggested a post iso roadtrip to Mildura to stock up on the ice cream.
