It sounds like a joke but for John Elliott; it’s the life changing adventure he was looking for.

By his own admission, John was in a rut. A successful one. He was making lots of money and living his best life.

But in a scene almost from the script of the hit TV show *Billions*, John quit his job, gave away his Audi R8 to charity and started looking at what to do next.

“I had a moment where I had a nice car – one that I never thought I could never afford. Then a friend got the same car but the next model up. So I started looking at new cars. But then I thought I should just be happy where I was at,” John says.

“So instead of buying a new car, I gave my car to charity and there was a certain feeling I got.”

Soon after John was at a dinner party. Someone had mentioned camels in a conversation and like a thunderbolt; John immediately thought he would buy some camels and start a trek and a simpler life.

Where do you get camels? Well, Facebook, of course.

When John found five in Millmerran in Queensland, he decided to collect them and walk them back home to Perth via the scenic route

He left on his birthday on April 11 last year and 13 months into the trek, he’s only just arrived in Victoria’s high country. And the arrival wasn’t a quiet one either. More on that later.

In his own words, John admits to *The Good News* the trip is a bit “Forrest Gumpy”.

But he said the response from those who cross his path has been incredible.

“We started the trip in the drought in Queensland. We then walked into the bushfires in NSW. And now we’re experiencing the coronavirus. Everywhere we go we get this Mexican hat wave of smiles because we’re giving people a random reason to smile.”

For the best part, it’s just John, the five camels and Rusty, his cattle dog cross dingo.

There’s been a lot of people who join in the journey though.

“There was a French traveller. A Belgium traveller. Friends from Perth have joined us. We’ve passed houses and the owners have asked if they can join us for the day. People walk and chat. It’s been kinda nice.”

John has also appreciated the quiet times too. It’s allowed him to take another journey – self-discovery.

“I built a successful business and had success beyond what I expected. The challenge to continue would have been to have a bigger house, faster car, more money. I would have only done that to be competitive.

“Back in the business world, if there was money coming in the door, you could justify any decision – good or bad. This is something that didn’t have a dollar sign attached to it.

“It’s hard to have some serious conversations with yourself with so much noise around you, social media and shaping the decisions you make. Now I have no reception, sometimes weeks or months. And I’m having good outcomes.”

Currently John has no fixed address.

Although he admits he’s not completely slumming it. He has a big boom box, a 30-litre portable fridge, power supply and a movie projector that he projects onto a white sheet. “Most Wednesday’s I like to have movie night. You need to have a couple of creature comforts.”

Every night he sleeps in a swag and thanks to school visits and community gatherings across the country, John is welcomed into people’s arms. Towns let him stay overnight on school grounds, sports ovals and even next to ‘No Camping’ signs.

“I spent 99% of my time with the locals so you get a unique and guided experience on the way through,” John says.

Although his latest experience was one he wasn’t expecting. And it ended up making world-wide headlines.

The 38-year-old was walking along a track just out of Jamieson (200km north east of Melbourne) when one of the camels lost its footing and because they were all tied together, it dragged John and the other camels over a 40-metre cliff.

John sent out an emergency alert and soon after there were dozens of police, CFA and SES volunteers helping rescue them.

“It was an eight-hour ordeal but by some bloody miracle, we got out with some minor abrasions and that’s it.”

When *The Good News* spoke to John today, the trek was back on track (slowly) heading to Melbourne before boarding the Spirit of Tasmania to tour the Apple Isle because “no one has ever done a camel trek there”.

John says he misses his family and friends back in WA; but he says he doesn’t miss his Audi sports car. “To be honest, a camel turns more heads,” he says with a laugh.
