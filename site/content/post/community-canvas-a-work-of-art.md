  Chapel. And an equally impressive masterpiece with similar aerial challenges
  has emerged in the quaint Victorian town of Colbinabbin.

But what’s even more impressive is renowned artist Tim Bowtell finished the artwork on six silos in just 50 days.

The Colbinabbin project is the Benalla-based artist’s biggest artwork yet and visually tells the historic story of the stoic farming town, located 2 hours north of Melbourne.

Among the imagery is dedications to the Country Fire Authority, the railway that was the lifeline of communities like “Colbo”, billy buttons and a wedge tailed eagle representing the area’s flora and fauna as well as a farmer’s picnic and tractor pull.

More than 300 litres of paint and 70 cans of spray paint were used to create the artwork.

And while the coronavirus didn’t halt the completion of the painting; the easing of restrictions is now enabling visitors back to the town to view the completed work.

For those travelling in the state’s north, Colbinabbin is a blink and you miss it town.

But the colourful silos are sure to attract attention and give motorists a reason to stop and experience the friendly, farming community.
