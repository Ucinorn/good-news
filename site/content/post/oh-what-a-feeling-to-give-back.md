In just three weeks, Toyota has switched from making car parts to medical equipment that is now being used in hospitals to protect emergency workers on the frontline.\
Toyota had been discussing how they’d respond to the coronavirus when colour and coating technician Will Taylor came up with a design idea at 4am one morning to produce face shields.\
The design then evolved to a prototype by Toyota’s Product Planning and Development team and it was tested with medical experts. It then received TGA approval before going into production.\
Weighing just 58 grams, each shield can be made in about 60 seconds with about 400 shields being manufactured daily.\
“Every day, these people are literally putting their lives on the line to deal with this situation and we at Toyota have the advanced technology, design and manufacturing expertise to rapidly develop and produce the essential protective supplies they need,” said Toyota Australia Vice President of Sales and Marketing Sean Hanley.\
Toyota is also utilizing its cafeteria to cook 150 meals daily for emergency workers. The meals are being delivered to hospitals through charity Alex Makes Meals.
