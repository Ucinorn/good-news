Like many, lifelong fan Jayden Carter’s family has been under financial stress due to the coronavirus.\
After working through her finances with her husband, Stuart, they were heartbroken when they realised they had to cancel their Essendon club membership.\
Speaking to Fox Footy, Ms Carter said: “If I had a choice between me not going to the football or my kids not eating, obviously they need to eat.”\
The decision was even more heartbreaking for the Melbourne family because it would also mean they would likely lose the same seats that had previously belonged to her Grandmother, who was a member for more than 60 years. She died six years ago.\
Before cancelling the seats, Ms Carter decided she would try her luck asking if there was anything the club could do.\
She wasn’t expecting what happened next.\
In an email from the Bomber’s membership department, Ms Carter was told Essendon defender Michael Hurley had earlier contacted the department offering to personally help one bomber fan doing it tough.\
That fan was the Carter family; with the twice All-Australian offering to pay the $471 shortfall remaining on the Carter’s membership.\
The goodwill gesture left Mrs Carter in tears of joy.\
“My whole friggin’ year has been made. If we were allowed to hug others, I’d give Hurley the biggest friggin’ hug I possibly could,” she said.\
