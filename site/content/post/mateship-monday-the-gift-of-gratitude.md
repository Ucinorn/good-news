At the peak of Covid-19, her partner, Suzette, had been tested for the coronavirus and she saw first hand the crazy hours they were doing to process tests.

\
"In all the face of it, they were really great at getting stuff done," Julie says.

\
So when she went to see the doctor again for herself, she wanted to know how she could help.

\
"I said to my doctor, I'm happy to adopt you. And I asked if they wanted some shopping done or if they could cook meals for them. But they politely declined," she says.

\
"I then went to the cafe next door and thought I could create a tab where they could buy themselves meals or coffees. I just wanted to do something that was a small gesture."

\
The next day Julie got an email from the CEO saying they appreciated the gesture.

\
"It meant I could give the cafe some business and give them (the medical workers) some gratitude," says Julie.

\
The community conscious couple joined Nextdoor at the start of covid-19 because they appreciated the inspirational stories and messages from their community in South Kingsville in Melbourne.\
"We all need something like that in times like this."

\
In fact, her partner, Suzette, even started a community Whatsapp group after hosting a socially distanced mask and flask party in a nearby park. 

Her concept was simple: a forum where neighbours could "ask for help or offer help".

\
The group now has almost 50 members, including an industrial chemist who's now been supplying the neighbourhood with hand sanitizer.

\
"It's really made me proud of my suburb," Julie says.
