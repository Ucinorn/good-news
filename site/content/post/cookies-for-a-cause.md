The Byron Bay Cookie Co have rebranded their deliciously popular Milk Choc Chunk cookie to raise awareness and funds for R U OK?

It’s the second year the charity and the boutique biscuit brand have come together for the worthy cause.

Part of the proceeds from each cookie sold will be donated to R U OK?

And a sweet touch has been added this year with the co-branded cookie being baked in such a way that makes it easy to break in half and share with a family member, friend or work colleague.

R U OK? Is an Australian charity that focuses on suicide prevention by inspiring and empowering everyone to meaningfully connect with people around them and support anyone struggling with life.

Byron Bay Cookie Co marketing manager Emilie Emond says the cause means a lot to the brand and it’s employees.

“We’re thrilled to be baking the R U OK? cookie again. We encourage all our cookie lovers to stay connected by asking a simple question: are you ok?,” Emilie says.

R U OK? CEO Katherine Newton says it’s a valuable partnership.

“Sharing a cuppa and a treat is a good opportunity to start a meaningful conversation in a comfortable relaxed manner,” she says.

R U OK? Day is on September 10. The cookies are available in selected cafes, selected Coles and Coles Express outlets and via the website [www.ruok.org.au](http://www.ruok.org.au/).
