So he invited them to come over to his garage to belt out some pub rock.

He then decided to invite the whole street where he lives in Yaroomba on the Sunshine Coast.

Steve called it “Live in the Drive” and saw it as an opportunity for people to simply enjoy some live music because it was one of the things people missed during coronavirus restrictions.

“I dropped notes in the letterboxes of 40 houses in the street and said this is going on this Saturday night. Everyone said how cool, we’ll be there,” Steve said.

“It was a great way to meet the neighbours.”

Steve said social distancing was respected by the neighbours, with most residents watching from deck chairs while the younger kids played in the cull de sac.

The impromptu concert in the shadow of Mt Coolum was such a success; the neighbourhood is planning a second one.

“It was just a nice distraction for everyone for a few hours on a Saturday night. It was great to see so many people from 8 years old to 65 all out enjoying themselves.”

Steve - a full-time freight broker – has been a musician for 30 years and said he’s been fortunate to pick and choose his gigs over the years.

“I love entertaining people. I want to bring people into my room and that night the driveway became my room. That’s when music is the best.”

He’s since had neighbours comment how much fun they had – the greatest compliment for any musician – and they are now asking for it to be a regularly community event.\
