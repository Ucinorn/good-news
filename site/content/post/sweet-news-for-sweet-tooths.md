The Polly Waffle chocolate bar is set to make a comeback after the Federal Government granted an Adelaide chocolate maker support through the Manufacturing Modernisation Fund.

The $1 million injection will allow Robern Menz – who bought the Polly Waffle and Violet Crumble brand from Nestle – to bring back the iconic Aussie favourite more than a decade after it disappeared from supermarket shelves.

The $50 million fund is to allow Australian manufacturers to modernise how they do business in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Polly Waffle project, estimated to be in excess of $5 million, will also create 38 jobs for South Australian workers.

But it’s unclear how long chocoholics will have to wait to indulge in the marshmellowy, wafery, chocolatey treat; with the confectionary company expecting it’s return date to be sometime next year.

And while the coronavirus has literally brought the world to its knees; at least now there is something good coming from it.
