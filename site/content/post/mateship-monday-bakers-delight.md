The Melbourne resident, who lives in Essendon, has become a community baker in lockdown after being inspired by her own mother's passion for baking bread.

"I make bread two days a week," Pat says. "I was making it for a few neighbours then one neighbour put a post on Nextdoor and now I'm getting more customers. Everyone is loving it."

Pat is restricted to making just 20 loaves a day because she doesn't have an oven big enough to cater to the demand.

She said her mother always made bread on the farm where she grew up. Then a few years ago, Pat's children gave her a gift voucher to do an artisan bread making course.

"I had a love for it straight away.... I love the process," she says.

While it's taken a couple of years for Pat to perfect her style, family and friends have been the beneficiary of her baking.

She says each loaf is a labour of love and takes around two days to make from beginning to end.

Pre-covid Pat worked in retail for Country Road and says the bread business has been a nice distraction of what's been happening in Melbourne.

"It's so beautiful to bring the community together. They're thanking me so much for it... even though they are paying for it," she says.

And while Pat had to rush off to get another batch in the oven, she said she's looking to invest in something a bit bigger to ensure she can service the demand. "I have to always say I'm sold out," she says.
