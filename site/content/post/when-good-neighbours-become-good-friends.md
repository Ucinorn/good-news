  For Connie Spicer and Geoff Boughton, it’s almost like the Neighbours theme
  song was written for them.

Although they’ve only lived next door to each other for 2.5 years, a tragedy has led to an incredible friendship that will last a lifetime.\
Their story is the first Nextdoor “Mateship Monday” story for *The Good News*.\
Connie’s husband, Stu, died suddenly of a heart attack just over a year ago, leaving her to raise the couple’s son, Archie, 8, and daughter, Sally, 5.\
Overcome in grief, it was a simple offer of help after her husband’s funeral that was a turning point for the Perth widow.\
“He was always a lovely neighbour but I didn’t know him that well,” Connie says.\
“He offered to help me put in a security system, then he was helping do things in the garden, pruning, he would check on me to see if I was emotionally OK and he even bakes bread and would drop some over.\
“He was my go to person… almost like a dad,” she says.\
For Geoff, he always had a lot of time for the family – especially her husband Stu – and he understood the pain of grief after losing his own mother.\
“It was tragic. I just made sure I was around and could help in anyway,” a humble Geoff says, while downplaying his generous nature.\
But Connie says it’s his extreme generosity that could never be repaid.\
“There was a fathering project for the kids at school and because my kids didn’t have a male to take them, Geoff went. He takes my son, Archie, to a nearby lake to use a remote control boat he got for his birthday… literally, everywhere around my house, I can see something Geoff has done to make my life easier.”\
So when Geoff helped Connie build a chicken coop, it was only natural the way to repay the favour was to name one of the hens after Geoff.\
“He’s made such a difference. He’s made me stronger.”\
But his generosity doesn’t stop at the Spicers home. Down the street, another neighbour has also lost her husband and he’s equally helpful at her house too.\
At his own home, Geoff is married and has three grown-up children and grandchildren. He also has distinguished career as an engineer that has earned him a Member of the Order of Australia earlier this year for his significant service to engineering and to professional bodies.\
But the accolades didn’t stop there.\
Forever grateful, Connie secretly nominated Geoff in the second annual Nextdoor “Celebrate Your Neighbour” competition to celebrate Neighbour Day.\
“To be honest, I thought the Nextdoor award was a local competition in Perth. Then I assumed it was a WA thing. I had no idea it was national,” Connie says laughing, adding she was happy Geoff got the kudos he deserved.\
“I was absolutely blown away,” Geoff says.\
His motivation is simple: “I enjoy helping.”\
