The chocolate makers have thrown a bone to South Australia’s Royal Society for the Blind by adopting the latest H litter of Guide Dog puppies, who will now proudly carry the surname Haigh.

The nine-week old puppies have been named Honey, Humphry, Hana and Hachiko.

The generous offer has come as a massive boost for the RSB, who like many charities have been severely affected by a downturn in donations since COVID-19.

Haigh’s Chocolates Chief Executive Alister Haigh says it’s delighted to support the worthy cause.

“The RSB does extraordinary work for the South Australian community and we are proud to support the important role that their Guide Dog program plays. And being able to add Haigh to the name of these four puppies is a lovely bonus,” he says.

He also adds there was a nice connection in naming one of the pups.

“We thought Honey was appropriately sweet,” Alister says.

The RSB’s emergency campaign has so far raised $85,000 of it’s $120,000 target.
