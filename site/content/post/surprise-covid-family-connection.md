Danielle Askew has connected a nation throughout COVID-19 with her ‘bin isolation outing’ initiative.

The fun idea came about almost three months ago when a friend posted a meme that she was excited to take out her bin.

Danielle, who lives in Harvey Bay, dared her dress up for the outing; even creating a Facebook page to celebrate the concept.

“I was shocked… by week three I had one million members,” says Danielle to*The Good News*.

But there was a bigger shock to come.

On this day, 31 years ago, Danielle was married. Her flower girl was a little girl named Astrida, who was her foster sister’s daughter.

“Back then I thought she was my baby doll. I fell in love with her,” says Danielle.

Sadly, they lost contact.

“Life happened and I lost touch. Over the last 31 years I have worried about her, wondering if she was OK.”

Then during the ‘bin isolation outing’ phenomenon, among the many messages Danielle received on Facebook, one private message stood out asking if she was Zandra Askew’s daughter.

Danielle immediately knew who it was.

“We’ve been texting every day since… I’m so happy to have her back in my life. She lives 12 hours up north and we are planning to meet up after iso.”

Danielle’s story shows good karma does exist in the world.
