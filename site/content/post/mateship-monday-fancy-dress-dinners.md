Locked in self isolation for the second time, the family of four from Melbourne decided to inject some creativeness to curtail covid boredom.

The idea came from their teenage daughter, Sophia. Following a particularly raucous day online with her friends, planning and participating in a virtual pretend wedding.

Sophia was flat after the event knowing that she had weeks before she could see her friends in person again. So she came up with Sunday night dress up night for the family.

The idea was enthusiastically embraced by parents Simon and Bianca and brother, Charlie.

Since then, the family have had five fancy dress dinners with themes including Coachella, wild west, bogans, goth night and the 1950s.

“The first night was so funny, Charlie and I had spent a couple of hours getting ready, putting on goth makeup and organising our outfits. We came out to the kitchen at the designated 6.30pm reveal to find Mum and Dad (who we thought might be a bit half-arsed about it) fully Goth-ed up," Sophia says.

Mum, Bianca, says the theme night comes with rules, including the costumes can’t be sourced out of the family home and the theme is only made known at dinner on Friday night, giving them 48 hours to prepare their costume. She also says each other’s outfits are kept secret until the reveal at Sunday dinner.

The weekly family photo has also been a hit on social media with their followers waiting for the posts each week and then judging who is the best dressed.

“It really has been a lot of fun. We actually can’t believe how many people are watching on social media and laughing at/with us” Bianca says.

The family say it’s been a highlight of fairly mundane weeks during covid; although they are adamant it won't continue after covid restrictions are lifted.

“This is definitely a lock-down only thing!”
