The Nextdoor member from Athelstone in Adelaide has recently signed a contract with a US recording company to record the complete Mozart Sonatas. The five-CD project will take almost a year to complete. 

Gil has been performing for over 50 years now and he admits this is the ultimate encore to his professional career.

His love of music started early. He was seven when The Beatles sent the world into a frenzy and Gil would often listen to their hits with his older sister and brother on their parent’s radiogram. But when they went off to play, Gil would wander through his parent’s eclectic record collection and it’s where he first found Mozart.

Gil, 65, says his father, who was also a very good pianist, was an early inspiration although he died of cancer when Gil was 11. He says he believes music helped him deal with the grief.

Today, Gil is one of only 4-5 pianists in the world who can play Mozart’s entire piano works.

“Mozart is the most challenging music of all,” Gil says. “Musically, it is almost impossible to really play well because the music is so perfect. No one’s technique is that perfect.”

Gil explains the recording company wanted to release the CD recordings because of the high resolution of the music compared to downloads, which are obviously more popular these days. In fact, they will be the highest resolution of any recordings in the world which will future proof them for decades to come.

Gil has played at the famed Carnegie Hall twice in his career and regularly plays all around the world. However, he says he still loves to call Adelaide home.

He says people often ask why he doesn’t live in New York or London.

“Many of my friends and colleagues around the world ask why don’t you live in New York, London or Berlin… My answer is Adelaide is one of the most liveable cities in the world,” Gil says.
