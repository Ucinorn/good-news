Back when we could all come together, the Perth resident ran regular outdoor movie nights from her front garden for her neighbours to enjoy and socialise during the warmer months.\
But when the coronavirus struck, the dance teacher feared the worst for her community.\
“I can’t imagine a week without dancing so I decided to run a Friday sundown session for any neighbours who fancied getting out on their verge for a bit of a boogie,” Joanne says.\
“Everyone was feeling a bit isolated and flat staying at home so I needed to do something.”\
Each week, Joanne makes a playlist including lots of genres of music to cater for the broad age groups. Dancers range from 9 months old to 89 year years old and they can also text Joanne with any personal requests.\
She then sets up speakers on her nature strip and the neighbours emerge from their homes to warm up before the 6pm kick off.\
The freestyle classes go for 40 minutes, before the group goes in to cool down.\
“It's so much fun, I've met new neighbours, we get cars beeping as they drive past… I’ve been told by neighbours it’s the highlight of their week,” says Joanne.\
Some weeks, the group even have a cheeky glass of wine – 1.5 metres apart, of course.\
“I have loved just being able to share what I love best in these difficult times with my community and friends,” Joanne says.\
