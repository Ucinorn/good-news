Rebecca Mahoney is tapping into the cultural zeitgeist through her own designs; the latest a portrait of jailed Tiger King star Joe Exotic.

Her other designs include US President Donald Trump with a runny nose, a bat and a single roll of toilet paper.

"The idea of embroidering current affairs is absurdly funny to me," Rebecca says. "My first one was 'COVID-19' in a very virus-ey green with little tendrils and things escalated quite quickly from there."

She said the new hobby was inspired by UK/Icelandic hand embroidery artist James Merry.

"My self-isolation journey has been a rollercoaster. I'm trying to use the time constructively and do things I don't usually have time for, like trying new recipes, reading more and dabbling in the arts and crafts."

Rebecca says the Joe Exotic design was much harder than she anticipated; using his mugshot that she found on Google and tracing the design onto linen.

For those wondering how long it took: "About a week of evenings, give or take... Or as I prefer to measure time now, one and a half seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm."

The finished designs will be framed and hung in her bathroom or gifted to (lucky) friends.

Rebecca says she's taking suggestions for her next designs. Stay tuned.
