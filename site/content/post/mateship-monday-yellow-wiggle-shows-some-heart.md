  But his latest campaign is to ensure the nation's heart health isn't one of
  them.

Page - who was one of the founding members of The Wiggles - suffered a sudden cardiac arrest while on stage performing at a bushfire relief concert in Sydney in January. He survived after the crew performed CPR while an off-duty nurse in the crowd used a defibrillator to keep him alive until paramedics arrived.

Days later, Page gave the thumbs up from his hospital bed; adamant to use his second chance to help others avoid the same scare.

"Being told that I had suffered a sudden cardiac arrest, let alone the fact that I was only one of 10% of people that survive, totally rocked me," Page told *The Good News.*

"It has opened my eyes to this 'epidemic' that consistently robs our country of people that are at the heart of the nation – young, or old, Australians who contribute to the value of the country in terms of their productivity, and in the lives of their family.

"I realised that had I not survived my cardiac arrest, my children would have been left without a father, my wife without a husband, my parents without a son – and this total devastation amongst families is happening every single day of the year, at a rate of around 3 people per hour. These stats horrified me and spurred me into action."

Page and his not-for-profit, Heart of the Nation, have partnered with Nextdoor to save lives. On September 19 at 7pm, the platform is hosting a virtual CPR training class hosted by Page and Surf Lifesaving Australia.

"Being empowered to use CPR in a situation like mine, means that you know you can confidently walk away from that event knowing that you did all you could to save a life. You will not ever have to think “What if I had known CPR”.

Jennie Sager, Head of Nextdoor Australia, says Nextdoor's mission is to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighbourhood, and a neighbour, to rely on.

"It's important to us that this meaningful connection translates from the online world into the offline world, which is exactly why we've teamed up with Greg to launch the "Heart of the Neighbourhood" campaign. Together, we have the chance to save Aussie lives and to help people feel safer in their local communities by knowing that there is a neighbour nearby who can help them in a time of need."

Page says the survival stats are simply, not good enough.

"Bystander response to a sudden cardiac arrest can literally mean the difference between life and death. And the more people that we have in the community that understand that message, as well as how to respond, the better chance we have of seeing more survival stories such as mine.
