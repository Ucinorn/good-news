She disappeared from the home in Melbourne’s northern suburbs of Alyssa Ianno, who was dog-sitting Miko for a friend over the weekend.\
Once upon a time, if your dog was missing, you’d print out flyers and distribute them throughout your neighbourhood in the hope you’d get a phone call. But Alyssa is a Nextdoor member so she wrote a lost dog post immediately.\
Very quickly, people in her community replied with comments.\
Vivian wrote the dog wasn’t at a nearby park she’d just come from. Then Bec pointed Alyssa to another community good karma page who had also posted about the missing dog.\
Sure enough, Miko had been found by a local family who looked after her until Alyssa was able to come and collect her.\
Alyssa then jumped back onto Nextdoor to thank the family and Bec, who connected the dots.\
Head of Nextdoor Australia Jennie Sager says it’s stories like this that prove the benefit of Nextdoor.\
“We are constantly inspired by the way Aussie neighbours help each other on Nextdoor. Whether it’s finding a lost pet or item, sharing a great recommendation for a local business, or simply checking in on one another, Nextdoor is the perfect way to build stronger communities,” Jennie says.\
