The luxury retailer is celebrating Spring with it's annual Spring Flower Show; now in it's 35th year.

It's the culmination of more than 4000 hours of tireless work for a team of 15 horticulturists and florists, led by creative George Low.

And for the first time ever, flower fans can experience the intricate floral displays from home through virtual tours.

Ben Webster, DJs GM of Operations, said it was great to have shoppers back in store in a Covid-safe environment.

"We've been extremely proud of what we have been able to produce in this time," Mr Webster said.

In addition to the floral arrangements, customers can also take a break from shopping and enhance their inner wellness in a Sound Lantern where they can mediate for 10 minutes or receive light therapy in The Dawn Garden.

"It's really about offering the customer more than the shopping experience," Bridget Veals, DJs GM of Womenswear said.\

The theme of the show this year is bees; with four bee hives of rescue bees moved to the roof of the department store. And what a beehive be without the Queen Bee, nicknamed "Beyonce".

The epic exhibition in the newly launched refurbished Elizabeth Street store is on until September 20.
