The manufacturer is spreading the love by giving away 50,000 pots of their Greek goodness to fans needing a change in luck.

Led by Chobani Australia Managing Director Lynley Radford (pictured), the brand is acting on one of their key values in giving back.

Lynley has personally been on the road doing the surprise and delight visits and her recipients including a nurse working on the frontline, a cancer survivor, a woman who lost her job and parents with a newborn baby. There was also a three-year-old who is also a Chobani super fan.

“It was such a rewarding experience to bring a little cheer to people in these tough times and it’s very clear that the work our Victorian ‘CHOteam’ is doing is more important than ever,” Lynley says.

The recipients were all nominated by friends and family; with more than 7200 nominations already received from across the country.

Each person who is selected gets a month’s supply of yoghurt. More than 1186 packages have been delivered to recipients already.

Surplus stock at the brand’s Dandenong is being donated to Foodbank Australia as part of their ongoing partnership; although Chobani have also pledged an additional 200 pallets of yoghurt (about 230,000 pots of yoghurt) to the charity this year.
