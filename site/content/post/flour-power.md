The Good Harvest Co wasn't due to launch until May; but thanks to demand caused by the coronavirus, their products including pasta and flour were rushed to sale, with flour hitting shelves at the end of March.\
The Good Harvest Co is an initiative by food manufacturer Rinoldi and works with Australian farmers who pride themselves on their responsible approach to agriculture.\
Responsible farming includes using techniques to safely grow crops that protect the environment as well as native species and the ecosystem.

The brand's mission is to give back and do good; with 10 cents from every product sold being given back to Rural Aid to provide support to struggling rural communities.\
“Our teams in NSW and VIC are working hard to keep up with the increased demand from Australian supermarkets at such unprecedented times” says Rinoldi's Emilie Emond.\
Regardless of what your skills are like in the kitchen; The Good Harvest Co ensures you're making something good.\
The Good Harvest Co is available at Coles and Woolworths.
