First published in 1980 by Pamela Clark and Maryanne Blacker, the cult cook book provided literally hours of adulation for children choosing their dream cakes.

Then mother's (let's be honest, it was the 80s) would literally curse at the thought of baking the jelly pool cake into the wee hours the night before their child's birthday or defying gravity with the lolly-filled dump truck.

In recent years, New Zealand's PM and all round legend Jacinda Arden added yet another reason for us to love her; taking her baking skills from the book to social media for her daughter's birthday.

Now - on it's 40th anniversary - the book is being re-released as a limited edition cookbook with some of the classic cakes as well as new recipes.

The Women's Weekly Children's Birthday Cake Book goes on sale for $19.99 from August 17 at newsagents, supermarkets and bookstores while stocks last.
