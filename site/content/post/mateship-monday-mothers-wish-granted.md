Irene is a loving mother to her son, Dale, who has had enough bad luck lately to last not one, but two lifetimes.

Dale, 57, is wheelchair-bound after losing both legs to diabetes. Then late last year, he lost all his possessions in a house fire at Taree during the horrific bushfires. Unfortunately, as he was staying with a mate, he was unable to claim any of his possessions on insurance.

And to confirm bad luck comes in three, Dale had a stroke that has seen him hospitalized for more than six months.

“He’s had a pretty rough trot,” Irene says. “It breaks my heart. He’s life has changed forever. He’s got more guts than I’ve got.”

And although the amputations restricted Dale’s mobility, it’s the most recent stroke that’s really debilitated him.

The father of two is currently in a care facility in Merrylands in NSW awaiting a permanent home where he will receive 24/7 care.

Irene reached out to her Nextdoor community in Kellyville in the hope that someone might be able to provide her with a second-hand Sony PlayStation that her son could use in his rehabilitation.

“Dale has no grip with his left hand after the stroke and I thought something like that might help strengthen his muscles,” she says.

“Everyone’s generosity has blown me away. I’ve had people from Glenmore to Glenhaven and Stanhope Gardens offering PlayStation consoles and even games.”

Irene says she plans to share the donations with other people currently in the same care facility who will also benefit from the entertainment systems.

She says she has been a member of Nextdoor since its inception and has enjoyed the sense of community; now more than ever.
