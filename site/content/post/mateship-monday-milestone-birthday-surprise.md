Instead, her mother, Ali, turned to the Nextdoor community to make her special milestone one she’d never forget.

Ali posted a simple message to her neighbourhood: “It’s our gorgeous girl’s 21st birthday. As we can’t celebrate with a party, we’d love it if our neighbours and friends could drive past and beep the horn to let her feel the love of our beautiful Mandurah.”

But Alice had no idea about the post.

On the morning of her birthday, she asked her mum why she was setting up a table, decorated with balloons, out the front of their house.

“She asked what I was doing… then she said: ‘OMG, what have you done?’,” Ali says, laughing.

Before they knew it, there was literally a procession of cars driving past tooting their horns, singing happy birthday and even delivering small gifts. Many of the well-wishers were people the Armistead’s didn’t even know.

“An elderly couple walked past and dropped off a box of chocolates. People were going past with balloons. It was a great atmosphere and it made Alice’s day a special one,” Ali says.

Later in the day, the family celebrated with their own sunflower-themed party because the flower is a family favourite.

“It really was a much better day than we had planned,” she says.

Ali has been a member of Nextdoor for two years. She never imagined the important role it would play for their family during the coronavirus.

“I think it’s handy for people to swap things, let people know what is going on. But it really connects communities,” Ali says.
