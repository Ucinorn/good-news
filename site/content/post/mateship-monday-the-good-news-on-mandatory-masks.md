Underneath the container, a handwritten note says: "For free if you need."\
It's a simple gesture by the owners of the New Star takeaway restaurant in Balmain but it's the latest way communities are coming together during the covid pandemic.

\
When face masks were made mandatory in Victoria, a community post on Nextdoor was flooded with messages.

\
Nextdoor member Greg from Ascot Vale in Victoria wrote: "Our cloth masks arrived today. All ready to help protect everyone in our neighbourhood."

\
And Maria from Hadfield said her Nonna, who is making fabric masks to help pass the time in self-isolation, was selling hers for $10. "(She) needs to cover costs of the elastic, material, thread and sewing machine electricity". They were even delivering the masks for free to residents living in high risk areas and were unable to leave the house.

\
Other members suggested masks made by SisterWorks, a not-for-profit social enterprise, who are making up to 10,000 masks a week.

\
Due to the success of the masks, Sisterworks has been employing additional staff to cater for the demand.\
Sisterworks is aimed at building the confidence and mental well-being of female migrant, refugee and asylum seekers. They now have 30 women making masks from home.
