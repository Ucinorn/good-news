That’s because most of the streets in the new estate in Rockbank have been named after international cricket legends.

It’s only right there is a Tendulkar Drive named after Sachin Tendulkar, of course. There’s also Waugh Street (Steve Waugh), Dev Terrace (Kapil Dev), Akram Way (Waseem Akram), Hadlee Street (Sir Richard Hadlee), Sobers Drive (after Sir Garry Sobers) and Garner Grove (Joel Garner).

City of Melton Mayor Cr Lara Carli told SBS Hindi it was great to see a positive response to the street names.

“Street names in our City are usually submitted by developers and approved by Council if they meet Office of Geographic Names guidelines,” Cr Carli said.

“It’s great to see a positive response to these names and it’s something I’m sure the developer and surrounding residents can be proud of.”
