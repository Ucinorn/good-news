And two blokes are making it super easy with Hugs and Heroes - a simple campaign that also makes a big impact to those in need.

Co-founder James Ward said the idea came about after a few mates had businesses struggling because of COVID-19. So rather than watch Netflix all day, they decided to do something positive with their time.

“It’s a pretty simple concept – allowing people to send Hugs and honour our healthcare heroes through specially created mugs and t-shirts. Every purchase pays it forward as well, buying a coffee for a healthcare worker via @buythemacoffee and six meals for people in need via OzHarvest,” James says.

Due to the response to the Hug in a Mug offer, the guys created a special Mother’s Day version of a mug with the text “World’s Best Mum and Home School Teacher” written on it.

“It’s a good option for all Dads out there who aren’t going to be saved by their kid’s craft from school this year,” James says.

Arnott’s have also supported the idea providing (mum’s favourite) Tim Tams for every mug purchased. “They loved how we were not just helping people in isolation, but also helping people in need and saying thanks to our Healthcare workers.”
