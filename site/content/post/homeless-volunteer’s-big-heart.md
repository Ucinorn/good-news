A hole in a fence enabled her to use an outside toilet next door. Unfortunately, it’s recently been fixed so she’s no longer afforded the luxury.\
The 50-year-old has been homeless for two-and-a-half years after she fled an ugly relationship plagued by five years of domestic violence.\
“I was promised I wouldn’t be left homeless. But here I am,” Alice says.\
Bravely telling her story, Alice says she grew up in a typical family struggling to make ends meet and unable to take family holidays. She was bullied at school but she never knew why.\
She reflects back to when she was 16 years old catching a bus from the city back to her home, when she noticed a homeless person at the bus stop. Dozens of office workers ignored the person; but Alice gave the man five dollars. It was a lot to her but she didn’t care. Someone needed it more.\
By her nature, Alice is generous. And while she doesn’t have much to give; she’s found a way to fulfil her want to give to others.\
Alice is a volunteer with Melbourne charity 300 Blankets and works at the Soul Kitchen, a weekly program each Sunday that provides three-course meals for people who are struggling financially or seeking social connection.\
It’s not her first volunteering gig. In fact, she was volunteering with multiple charities long before she found herself homeless.\
“It’s in my DNA. The people I am working alongside are amazed I am even doing it. But it’s important to me,” Alice says.\
Alice has always loved to cook.\
From the age of 9, she was forced to learn her way around the kitchen when her mum would cook veggies until they were grey.\
As a teenager, she would visit friend’s homes and takeover their kitchens. “I was the original surprise chef. I always had a passion for food. I love the flavours and textures and how they can change the way you perceive things.”\
It’s the same passion that has resonated at the Soul Kitchen.

“It’s a place for people who may not get a chance to have a sit down meal. They have a meal served to them in the same way we would for loved ones. We love these people. We want them to be healthy and happy.”\
“It’s more than a meal though, it’s social inclusion,” she says, saying regulars include young to elderly people, couples and families.\
She’s matter of fact when it comes to the irony that after each shift helping others in the kitchen, she returns back to the van where she sleeps.\
“There is always someone worse off that yourself. I’m living in a car but there is someone living in a doorway in the city. At least I have a roof over my head.”\
The vehicle is the second van she’s owned. The first was destroyed by vandals.\
She admits her parents, who she speaks to once a year on her birthday, helped her buy the van. She says their estranged relationship is loving but “difficult”.\
“I can get overwhelmed by it all. It’s just a stage of life.”\
Alice is also currently studying commercial cookery, with plans to run a food education program for people in need. She wants to teach people how to make their favourite meals themselves.\
“The end goal of this is to get employment in community services or food or both.\
“Once I get settled in a place, I am planning on buying a commercial food truck and getting a group of volunteers, get back on the road selling hot food. Free food for people who need it but funded by others can pay.”\
Due to the coronavirus, the Soul Kitchen has been forced to close. 300 Blankets is still doing their outreach work, providing blankets to the homeless.\
And the lack of social interaction and giving has left a big hole in Alice’s heart. “We’re hurting because we can’t service the community.”\
Personally, it’s also made life a lot tougher. The gym who lets her use their showers is shut. And so is a university who lets her use their facilities too.\
Instead, the situation is giving Alice more time to devote to her passion: planning her future and a greater determination to continue helping others.\
“I think what you get back from volunteering. emotionally you get a sense of reward and giving value to someone else’s life. And it helps you resolve some of your own issues. The love you feel back bolsters you to process your own problems.”\
