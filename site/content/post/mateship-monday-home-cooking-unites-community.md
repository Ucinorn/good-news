description: For Noora Al Matori, food is what brings people together. So when
  the nation went into self-isolation, she knew it was her home cooked meals
  that would unite her community.

“I have a Middle Eastern background… It’s how we get together with food. It’s not just a cup of tea or coffee. It’s always big meals; it’s the simplest way to offer something to other people in need,” Noora says.

Noora advertised her free meals through her Nextdoor neighbourhood of Palmerston in Canberra. And the response was heart-warming.

“I offered neighbours in our suburbs to share some of our dinner with them. Some people even offered to help with the shopping and delivery of meals,” she says.

Each day, Noora prepares four to five different dishes from soups to stews and dips to delicious pastries. She fills plastic containers that are then either home delivered or picked up by people who have shown interest in her generous offer.

“Cooking is the only way to help. That’s what I know. People do say my meals are great. If I can help others, I’m definitely more than happy to do that.”

When *The Good News* spoke to Noora, crispy chicken was on the menu along with soup.

Noora is also assisted in the kitchen by her four-year-old daughter, Jamila, who has inherited her mother’s love of cooking.

“She does her little bit to help too. She makes cookies with dates and chia seeds and puts them in bags to go with the meals. Sometimes when the containers are returned, there will be a small gift in there (for her). People are beautiful,” she says.

For Noora, food is her passion. And although she has a business degree, her dream is to one day run her own café.

“I generally love cooking. One day I hope to have my own café that is very genuine to the community and at a reasonable price,” she says.

And given the response to her home cooked meals already, her dream will be a success once it becomes a reality.
