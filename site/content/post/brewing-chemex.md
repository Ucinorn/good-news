  what it lacks in size it certainly makes up in community and entrepreneurial
  spirit.

And it’s probably why thecorner shop – that dubs itself the “greatest convenience store on earth” – also boasts almost 20,000 Instagram followers.

\
In fact, it’s fair to say it’s owner, Hazem Sedda, has well and truly hit convenience store fame at a level not seen since Apu from the Kwik-E-Mart starred on The Simpsons.

\
“My customers don’t see us as a corner shop. They come to see me and come to have a chat with me,” he said. “I also never look at them as a customer, I see them as friends.”

\
“What I do makes them happy. The happier they are, the happier I am.”

\
Just weeks ago, Hazem made national headlines when he was selling toilet paper when it was in extreme demand. A simple sign called out the craziness when he had priced one toilet roll at $3.50 and two for $99. “Our Instagram account isn’t about pushing sales for us, it’s about creating a community and showing our customers and how beautiful people are,” Hazem said.

\
In fact, Hazem celebrates his customers every day by featuring them as the Customer of the Day in a social media post that tells the unique stories of his followers, some who travel interstate to visit the store.\
Born in Palestine, Hazem is a fully trained commercial pilot but says it’s his passion for working behind the counter and the community that keeps him grounded.

“Being a pilot, you don’t communicate with humans. It’s all numbers and computers. Very rarely do you see a pilot speaking to a passenger on a plane. But I love to meet people and I’m much happier doing this. And I also get to be my own boss.”

\
Hazem’s success has been assisted by TV personality Ben Fordham, who used to live in the neighbourhood and frequented the store as a customer.

\
If you are in Sydney, visit Hazem at the Redfern Convenience Store at 152A Redfern Street, Redfern. You’ll see for yourself it’s not just any milk bar.
