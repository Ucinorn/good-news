Ratio Cocoa Roasters in Brunswick have created an Easter bunny that’s perfect for self-isolation celebrations.\
With a white chocolate face mask, the coronavirus-themed chocolate treats are flying off the shelves of the Sydney Rd store.

\
Ratio’s owner Debbie Makin said the idea came from a customer.

\
“We were talking about what the coronavirus meant during the busiest time of the year for us and he came up with the idea. We did one for a post on social media and we were inundated with people wanting to buy the chocolates,” Ms Makin said.

\
Ratio specialises in small batch hand-crafted chocolates made using traditional chocolate making techniques and the world’s best single origin cocoa beans.

\
And while small businesses are pivoting to protect their livelihoods, Ms Makin said she’s been warmed by the sense of community by local businesses banding together to help each other out during the coronavirus crisis.
