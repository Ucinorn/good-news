  local mantra that stuck with him for life.

“It’s simple, you look after your community and your community will look after you,” Brooks, who’s better known as Brooksy, says.

However the saying has proven itself over the past week in Brooksy’s home in bayside Melbourne; when a thief struck at his Covid-inspired community library.

Just hours after the midnight robbery, Brooksy took to social media and posted a photo saying 125 of his books had been stolen from the Blanche Street Library in Brighton East.

Within hours, he had enough books to stack several libraries.

“It went crazy. I asked for anyone with spare books. My faith in human spirit has been restored, 100 per cent,” he says.

He says the library has been popular with adults and young families, with many kids getting back into books during the lockdown and choosing new books with their parents.

“They can steal from us but they can’t take this,” Brooks says.

“In today’s world the simply moneyless things are priceless from a caring community.”

Now, if you think Brooksy looks familiar. You’re right. 32 years ago, the Pom and his mates shot to fame on Hey Hey It’s Saturday as The Music Men.

Brooksy was the leader of the group on the popular Red Faces.

“We’ve done some research and we can confirm we were the first boy band,” Brooksy laughs.

Every year, the men reunite in October on the Sunshine Coast to play in a soccer competition and reminisce about their 15 minutes of fame.

And while the reunion won’t be happening this year, they’ve penned a 2020 version of The Music Men. Stay tuned.
