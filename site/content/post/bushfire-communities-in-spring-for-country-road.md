The campaign was shot on properties ravaged by fire in December in Glen Alice, a small community at the base of the Blue Mountains in the Capertee Valley, three
hours west of Sydney.
However, seven months later green shoots are starting to reappear from blackened tree trunks and fauna is starting to return to
the area.


Steve Dalli, who is the captain of the Capertee Fire Brigade, is normally seen wearing
firefighting overalls rather than sweats and shirts. But he said he enjoyed the opportunity to
partake in the fashion shoot.
“Being a firefighter during recent times has been particularly stressful. After 2.5 years of
drought and the bushfires, to now see the trees and local bushland slowly coming back to
life is absolutely fantastic – and seeing our community’s story at the forefront of the Country
Road campaign for the world to see is quite an honour,” said Dalli.
Country Road Managing Director, Elle Roseby said the brand was proud to be able to use
their voice to shine a light on fire-affected areas.
"The incredible stories that are told in this year’s campaign – quite simply couldn’t have been
told without the people at the heart of them,’ said Roseby.
Traditional land owner and renowned artist Peter Swain also features in the campaign and
talks of the importance of regeneration.


"The land itself is healing after the fires. Regeneration is about us as people engaging with
the land and the animals in a way again that we are equals and that we are growing
together. We must put magic back into the land,” said Swain.
Ironically, Peter's partner, Jo, was a Country Road model back in the early 1980s. Although
he said she didn't give him any tips ahead of the shoot, he said he was looking forward to
travelling to the city to see the campaign in store. 
The Country Road Spring range is now on sale.
